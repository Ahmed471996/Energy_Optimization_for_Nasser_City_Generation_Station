# Energy Optimization for Nasser City Generation Station

## Introduction

Optimization methods are techniques that enable us to solve optimization problems. For this, it is necessary to optimize the working of a system, minimizing or maximizing one of its many objectives or performance criteria.
Here, the main purpose of the project is to minimize the COE (of a hybrid PV/WT/BM isolated system) to the lowest value regardless to GHG and LPSP. However, two other cases will be considered with GHG minimized and LPSP minimized. Also, an ON-GRID condition is studied.
For optimization, genetic algorithm (GA), particle swarm (PSO) and HOMER software optimizer are used as methods of optimization.

## Genetic algorithm optimization method
The genetic algorithm is a Reinforcement algorithm method for solving both constrained and unconstrained optimization problems that is based on natural selection, the process that drives biological evolution. In GA, a population of strings, also called chromosomes encode an individual solution for optimizing the result, evolves toward certain more efficient solutions.

## Particle swarm algorithm optimization method (PSO)

Particle swarm optimization is similar to the genetic algorithm technique for optimization in that rather than concentrating on a single individual implementation, a population of individuals (a “swarm”) is considered instead.

## Briefing about Nassir city

Nasser City is one of the fourth-generation cities established under Presidential decree no. (78) For the year 2017 on an area of 6006.2 acres. The city of Nasser is located on the western desert road and is 4 km away Km from Asyut International Airport. The city was divided into six residential neighborhoods that are implemented in three stages as well as the industrial zone and the services area. The total expected population density of the city is 345 thousand people in the year (2032).
The first stage is currently underway with an area of 1600 acres in addition to
Egypt Housing Project and Social Housing Project in Phase II. Total population density expected for the first phase 100 thousand people [8].

## Weather data

In today's electrical grid, as the integration of renewable energy sources (RES) in the grid increases, the uncertainty in the available generation also rises. In particular, the larger the share of RES in the grid, the more dependent is the electricity generation on weather conditions, and in turn, the more unpredictable electricity generation becomes. This uncertainty also affects the demand side as electricity consumption is also weather-dependent and every kWh produced must be consumed somewhere.
